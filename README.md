# Participatory Platforms and Social Network Analysis

## Course Description
Social networks and participatory platforms on the Internet have given rise to new forms of relationship between human beings. In addition, the availability of big data repositories of digital traces about these interactions makes it possible to investigate new social phenomena through computational approaches. This course will cover theory and methods of network science and digital methods tools to provide students with key resources to develop a project based on social network analysis techniques.

## Goals
To review fundamental concepts and techniques from computational social science and social network analysis, e.g., structural metrics, community detection methods and centrality measures.
To make visible, through case studies, the potential of digital methods to investigate social phenomena in the network society.
To provide the necessary knowledge to manage open source tools, which do not require programming skills, to capture, analyze and visualize data from social networks and participatory platforms.

## Project
Students will have to carry out a research project, over the course of four hands-on sessions, that will put into practice the contents reviewed in the four initial sessions. In particular, students will have to: 
propose a real case study of their personal interest,
establish a research question to be examined,
address the research question with techniques from social network analysis and visualization using open source digital methods tools like Gephi, DMI-TCAT, Netvizz, table2net and RAWGraphs. 

## Objectives
The main objective of this course is to discover how easy it is to collect, analyze and visualize data from participatory platforms and social networks, while also realizing how difficult it is to do so in a scientifically rigorous manner. For this reason, students will acquire a theoretical basis in network science for ensuring the correct application of digital methods. It will also be an objective to incorporate knowledge from other courses in Data and Design to enrich the quarterly project.
